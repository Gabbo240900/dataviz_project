This will be the repository for the data visualisation project

The code is strucutred in this way:
1) libraries importing
2) Dataset loading
3) dataset cleaning
4) Creation of static visualization (boxplot, barplot). They will be saved in the repository respectively as: 'coolboxplot.png' and 'coolbarplot.png'.
5) Creation of Geographic Heatmap - it will export a file called "us_flights_map.html", opening it will show the dynamic heatmap.
6) Initialization of dynamic Year by year analysis that will then be shown in the dash app. 
7) Network analysis, it will export a file called 'output_graph.html', opening it will show the dynamic network
8) Create the dash app. It can be found, after running the code on the localhost http://127.0.0.1:8055/ 


If the dash app does not work, try writing 'quit' in the terminal; then try again.
